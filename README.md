## Michael's User Manual


### My style


* I think in lists. I do my best planning in quiet solitude with a vi session, google doc, or vscode.
* I learn through progressive emersion and will tend to repeat things numerous times... it takes me approximately 50 times presenting a new topic before I feel comfortable.
* I start early. Usually in the gym by 5, out by 6:30 and at my desk by 7:30am
* I crash early — Usually in bed by 10pm. See above.
* I believe in thoroughly understanding a problem space and an array of possible solutions prior to reaching out for help. I am a fan of "unless otherwise directed (UNODIR)."
* I am self-taught and always learning and I work very hard at continual improvement. Ask me how I'm doing and you'll likely get - Never better... every day, just a little bit better.
* I try to find gratitude daily and I practice this through a daily, or at least a weekly list, shared with my family members.
* I believe in the concept of Radical Candor and do my best to work these concepts into my relationships and daily life. Difficult things that need to be said require the effort associated with establishing a relationship - first.
* I strive for transparency, almost to a fault and I value this when others demonstrate this with me.
* I strive to lead from the front. I work very hard to understand any area of responsibility prior to asking others to engage in it or execute on it.


### What I value

* I value physical and mental fitness. I do my best mental work when I'm physically fit so I tend to the physical as if my mental health depends upon it... every day.
* I value time and I respect the time of those with whom I interact. As such, I am compulsively early. If I'm not 15 minutes early, I feel late.
* I value open-mindedness. I believe in the ability of any individual to accomplish literally anything they set their mind to.
* I value creativity and courage. I love art and seeing personal creations that people have had the courage to share.
* I value transparency; Almost to a fault.
* I value curiosity. Natural curiosity is a rare commodity - I truly enjoy spending time with individuals that possess or cultivate this trait.

### What I don’t have patience for

* Closed-mindedness. I can't... I don't have the ability... I don't know how to... I never... I'm just not that type... If you are the type of person that clings to these phrases and uses them repeatedly, you'll likely find that I will keep my conversations with you to a bare minimum. I enjoy spending time with people who live in the solution, not the problem.
* Lateness is something that I interpret as a very clear signal that a person doesn't value my time.
* Inability to accept personal responsibility for one's own actions.
* Self-centeredness. How often do you start sentences with I, me, my... do you relate to a person's conversation by sharing something about yourself - or do you want to learn more about the person and ask questions about them?
* Asking for help or bringing questions when you haven't made an effort to think through at least a few possible solutions.  See UNODIR above.

### How to best communicate with me

*   I prefer email in a professional setting to most other forms of communication except when you're delivering bad news or something urgent.
*   Slack, or text me for immediate responses and quick answers to questions that don't require an audit log. For something that's relatively important, like something that I'll need to keep a record of for future use - email me.
*   Regardless of the method - I'll meet you where you are - I want to talk with you and I want your feedback.

### How to help me

*   Come with solutions. Everyone has problems and I can and want to help solve some but it's refreshing and helpful when you bring not only challenges but solutions.
*   Introduce me to others with similar interests, or roles. Be a connector and you'll help me.
*   I work in a growing, fast-paced business and I'm hiring... if you're reading this, chances are we have shared interests. Reach out and say hi... perhaps we can help each other in some way.

### What people misunderstand about me

*   Because of my job, or from interactions we've had, you may assume I'm naturally an extrovert. This is far from the case. I struggle with large groups and in most social situations I need to work at finding a level of comfort. I do this through breathing, relaxation techniques and by drawing my attention to something outside myself... someone else, something concrete.
